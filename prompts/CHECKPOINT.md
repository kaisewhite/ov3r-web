  - [x] Proper navigation hierarchy and state management
  - [x] Eliminated duplicate navigation components
- [x] Added navigation context detection for proper routing

### Pages and Components

  - [x] Project dashboard with proper navigation
  - [x] Knowledge base management interface
- [x] Added placeholder cards for future services (ServiceA, ServiceB, ServiceC)

### Current Development State

- [x] Disabled authentication for development (redirecting directly to dashboard)
- [x] Header navigation fully functional
- [x] Basic routing between services implemented
- [x] Enhanced dashboard with interactive bento grid layout
- [x] AWS-style navigation patterns implemented
- [x] Context-aware navigation working correctly

## Known Issues

- Authentication currently disabled for development
- Some components need proper error handling
- API integration pending
- Testing coverage needed
- ~~Navigation components had duplicate implementations~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Breadcrumb trails showing duplicate paths~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Multiple sidebar menus appearing simultaneously~~ (Fixed)

## Notes

- Currently using CSS Modules for styling after migrating from styled-components
- Development focused on structure and navigation
- Enhanced dashboard with interactive bento grid layout
- Placeholder services ready for future implementation
- Navigation now follows AWS console patterns for familiarity
- Proper context switching between service and project views
