- [x] Added placeholder cards for future services (ServiceA, ServiceB, ServiceC)

### Current Development State

- [x] Disabled authentication for development (redirecting directly to dashboard)
- [x] Header navigation fully functional
- [x] Basic routing between services implemented
- [x] Enhanced dashboard with interactive bento grid layout
